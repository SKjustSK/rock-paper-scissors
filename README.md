# rock-paper-scissors

A simple game of rock paper and scissors, a piece of cake, right? RIGHT??

Skills I learned:
1. Making a website from scratch
2. Usage of hover in CSS
3. DOM manipulation
4. Event handling (particularly mouse clicks)
5. Using Javascript functions and conditionals to make an actual working game
